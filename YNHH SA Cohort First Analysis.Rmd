First creation of cohort by removing 
-minors
-excluded patients

```{r}
excluded_patients <- excluded_patients %>% add_value_labels(reason_to_exclude = c( "Seen earlier" = "1", "Patient reports not being assaulted" = "2", "not excluded" = "3", "Psych" = "4", "Eloped" = "5")) %>% to_factor()
excluded_patients %>% group_by(reason_to_exclude) %>% summarise(n=n())
n_excluded <-n_distinct(excluded_patients$pat_enc_csn_id, na.rm=TRUE) %>% as.character()
cat("-", n_excluded, "patients were excluded based on chart review.")
rm(n_excluded)
```

## creating cohorts

```{r}
excluded_patients <- full_merge_DF %>% filter(!is.na(exclude))
r_DF3 <- full_merge_DF %>% filter(is.na(exclude))
excluded_patients <- excluded_patients %>% add_value_labels(reason_to_exclude = c( "Seen earlier" = "1", "Patient reports not being assaulted" = "2", "not excluded" = "3", "Psych" = "4", "Eloped" = "5")) %>% to_factor()
excluded_patients %>% group_by(reason_to_exclude) %>% summarise(n=n())
n_excluded <-n_distinct(excluded_patients$pat_enc_csn_id, na.rm=TRUE) %>% as.character()
cat("-", n_excluded, "patients were excluded based on chart review.")
rm(n_excluded)
```

```{r}
post_WO <- full_merge_DF %>% filter(ed_arrival_date > sb_start) %>% filter(age >= 18)
```
