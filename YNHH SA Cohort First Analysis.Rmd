First creation of cohort by removing 
-minors
-excluded patients

```{r}
excluded_patients <- excluded_patients %>% add_value_labels(reason_to_exclude = c( "Seen earlier" = "1", "Patient reports not being assaulted" = "2", "not excluded" = "3", "Psych" = "4", "Eloped" = "5")) %>% to_factor()
excluded_patients %>% group_by(reason_to_exclude) %>% summarise(n=n())
n_excluded <-n_distinct(excluded_patients$pat_enc_csn_id, na.rm=TRUE) %>% as.character()
cat("-", n_excluded, "patients were excluded based on chart review.")
rm(n_excluded)```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
